        "In recent years, companies in various industries have shown a rapid increase in interest in artificial intelligence. Since 2011, companies that have developed and commercialized AI-related products and technologies have received more than 2 billion dollars in venture capital. Moreover, tech giants are investing billions of dollars in AI startups. According to Tracticaâ€™s Report, the enterprise AI systems market will grow to $11.1 billion in the 10 years after 2015 from 202.5 million dollars. The era of digital technology and artificial intelligence has come and brought about great positive change. Smart homes are becoming increasingly popular, but many older people have not been exposed to many existing technologies. They cannot quickly understand and use these technologies. An easy-to-use smart home assistant can help them a lot, especially for elderly people who live alone. This will be a worthwhile investment.\n",
